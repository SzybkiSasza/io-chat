ioChat
======


Chat project based on node.js and socket.io
-------------------------------------------
This chat project started as a simple tutorial project for learning socket.io, however author feels that it could transform into full-featured project :)

Usage
-----
Just clone the repository and run `npm install` and `node server.js` from main directory. Then navigate to `http:\\localhost:3000` and there you are!

Contributions
-------------
As for now - the project is in early alpha stage, however - if you feel you can contribute to it - just create an issue!
